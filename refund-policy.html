<h1>Here’s the refund policy I follow</h1>
<ul>
<li>The entire amount will be refunded if I can’t manage schedules after accepting a project.</li>
<li>I accept payment by milestones, there will be no refund for milestones completed (as agreed by the client).</li>
<li>If I can not finish the project within deadline, the client can ask for refund of the current milestone and they can end the contract</li>
</ul>
